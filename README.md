 COMPILING AND EXECUTING 
----------------------------------



In MySQL.prefpane :

     Start the mysql server in MySQL MYSQL.prefpane . 



 In the MySQLWokrkbench :

    * First create a database named employeez using the query :
    CREATE SCHEMA `employeez` ;
                                                                         
    * Then create the table employeez in the database employeez using the query :

    CREATE TABLE `employeez`.`employeez` (
    `id` INT GENERATED ALWAYS AS (),
    `name` VARCHAR(45) NOT NULL,
    `salary` VARCHAR(45) NOT NULL,
     PRIMARY KEY (`id`));


 In IntelliJ IDEA :

     Build the project, in the terminal using : ./gradlew build or click gradle tab and then click /Task/build .
       https://github.com/soniamathew/EmployeeManagement-using-SpringBoot-and-Hibernate/blob/master/1.png
    
     
     
     Run the Employee Application.
   
       https://github.com/soniamathew/EmployeeManagement-using-SpringBoot-and-Hibernate/blob/master/2.png
     
     
     Then the SpringBoot Application class will be run, tomcat will get started on port 9000 and mysql connection is also          made.


 In Postman :

     Make the Rest API requests as follows :-
     
     CRUD OPERATIONS :   (CREATE, READ BY ID, UPDATE AND DELETE BY ID)
     
     create : 
             method : POST , API endpoint : http://localhost:9000/employee/api/create
     
     read : 
           method : GET , API endpoint : http://localhost:9000/employee/api/read/{id}              -give the id.
     
     update : 
           method : PUT , API endpoint : http://localhost:9000/employee/api/update
     
     delete : 
           method : DELETE , API endpoint : http://localhost:9000/employee/api/delete/{id}         -give the id.
     
     
     After hitting the Rest APIs and the MySQL database, the results wil be displayed in postman as well as console of the IntelliJ IDEA.
